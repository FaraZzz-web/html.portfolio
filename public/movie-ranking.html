<h2>My Top 3 Favourite Ones  </h2>
<hr />
<h3>Interstellar</h3>
<P>For me, it was an emotional journey. I have been in love with space for a long time. Who am i? Where am i? Why am i here? Where will i go?

    Space travel would be something that would fulfill my soul. My dream, being in outer space. Watchin the Earth. Our fragile blue pearl, floating in space. If somebody would ask me if i would be willing to hop on a space ship, with a one way ticket, destined to travel thru space with no chance of returning home. i think i wouldnt hesitate to hop on that train. I am in such an awe to all the astronauts, getting to have the experience to see the world from a whole different perspective. </P>
<h3>The Dark knight Rises</h3>
<P>On first viewing, Rises was awesome. A spectacular tour de force of entertainment, stunts, spectacle, character, and violence. I was riveted by its muscular action and strong emphasis on the Bruce Wayne character. Bane was ferocious. I’ll never forget the moment I finally saw the famous Knightfall sequence play out — “I was wondering what would break first, your spirit … or your body!” — something I never thought I’d see on the big screen. Everyone in the theater gasped. My brother and I cheered. It was awesome.

        The performances were great. Christian Bale will likely always be my Batman of choice. Tom Hardy killed it as Bane, as did supporting players Gary Oldman, Joseph Gordon-Levitt (as Robin?), Marion Cotillard, and scene-stealer Anne Hathaway (as Selina Kyle/Catwoman, though her alter ego is never mentioned). The film was appropriately long but never boring, and just so happens to feature some of my all-time favorite Batman scenes.</P>
<h3>Titanic</h3>
<p>One of my favourite films is Titanic. I`m a great fan of romantic movies and I`m very keen on the history of the tragic Titanic. The movie tells the dramatic story of the Titanic with Leonardo Di Caprio and Kate Winslet as the main actors.
            In the year 1912 a young poor guy, Leonardo, travels by the gorgeous ship Titanic from London to New York with a big dream. On board he meets a fabulous, wealthy girl, Kate Winslet. He fells in love with her as soon as he sees this gorgeous girl. However, after a few days the ship hits an enormous iceberg and the tragedy begins to unfold. The Titanic starts sinking…
            The movie is very close to the real tragedy. It shows a beautiful love story with an extremely sad ending. The acting is first-rate. Leonardo Di Caprio`s and Kate Winslet`s performance is so brilliant that I cried during the whole movie.
            This movie brings a tear to your eyes. If you want to cry and melt down to a glamurous love story, I strongly recommend that you watch this movie. Titanic is well worth seeing.</p>
